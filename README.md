# deploy-immo-eliza

create a clear README to explain where your API is hosted and how to interact with it. Don't forget to mention:

- What routes are available? With which methods?
- What kind of data is expected (How should they be formatted? What is mandatory or not?)
- What is the output of each route in case of success? What is the output in case of error?
